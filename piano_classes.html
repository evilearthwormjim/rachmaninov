					 	Piano lessons are available Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday:
					 	<ul>
							<li>Classes are booked on a term basis.  Fees must be paid in full at the beginning of each term. </li>
							<li>Performing is highly encouraged! We have a Hot Chocolate Party every Christmas and a Summer 
								Recital at the end of the school year.  This is a great opportunity for our students to meet other 
								pianists and inspire or be inspired by their peers.</li>
							<li>Practice is absolutely crucial when learning an instrument.  The key to enjoyment and progress is consistent practice.  
								Students are given a practice journal that they must fill out each week.  
								This helps them and their teacher to keep a record of all their work and highlight what areas need improvement.  
								Students who practice a little every day improve much quicker than those who just do one panic practice session before their lesson!  
								As Suzuki said; “Knowledge is not skill. Knowledge plus 10,000 times is skill.”</li>
						</ul>
